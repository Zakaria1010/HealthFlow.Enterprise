## Sequence Diagrams Description

### 1. Complete Data Flow Diagram
**Purpose:** Shows end-to-end data flow through the entire system  

**Key Flows:**
- **Patient Registration:** Complete flow from UI to database with async processing  
- **Event Processing:** Parallel background processing using Channels and `Task.Run`  
- **Real-time Updates:** Live dashboard updates via SignalR  
- **IoT Integration:** Medical device data processing with alerting  
- **Health Monitoring:** System health checks and monitoring  

**Technical Highlights:**
- Microservices communicate via API Gateway  
- SQL Server for transactional data, Cosmos DB for analytics  
- RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery between services  
- Background workers use bounded channels for backpressure management  
- Real-time updates push data to frontend without polling  

---

### 2. Component Interaction Overview
**Purpose:** Simplified view of main component interactions  

**Key Interactions:**
- User accesses dashboard and sees real-time data  
- Patient registration triggers event-driven architecture  
- Background processing updates analytics data  
- Continuous processing of queue items  

**Architecture Patterns:**
- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)  
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)  
- Repository Pattern  
- Observer Pattern (via SignalR)  

---

### 3. Background Worker - Channel Processing Flow
**Purpose:** Detailed view of high-performance message processing  

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Bounded Channels:** Prevent memory overflow with backpressure  
- **Parallel Workers:** Multiple workers process messages concurrently  
- **Task.Run Pattern:** Offload CPU-bound work to thread pool  
- **Async Processing:** Non-blocking I/O operations  

**Performance Features:**
- Concurrent message processing with multiple workers  
- Efficient channel-based queuing mechanism  
- Automatic load distribution  
- Fault isolation between workers  

---

### 4. Error Handling & Resilience Flow
**Purpose:** Demonstrates system reliability and fault tolerance  

**Error Scenarios Handled:**
- **Database Failures:** Retry logic with exponential backoff  
- **Message Queue Failures:** Dead letter queue for failed messages  
- **Network Partitions:** Circuit breaker patterns  
- **Service Unavailability:** Graceful degradation  

**Resilience Patterns:**
- Retry with jitter  
- Circuit breakers  
- Dead letter queues  
- Async acknowledgment  
- Eventual consistency  

---

### 5. Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline
**Purpose:** Automated deployment and quality assurance  

**Pipeline Stages:**
- **Code Commit:** Trigger on push to main/develop branches  
- **Build & Test:** Restore, build, and run automated tests  
- **Security Scan:** Vulnerability assessment and code quality  
- **Containerization:** Build and push Docker images to ACR  
- **Deployment:** Blue-green deployment to Azure services  
- **Validation:** Health checks and smoke tests  

**Quality Gates:**
- Unit test coverage requirements  
- Security vulnerability thresholds  
- Performance benchmarks  
- Integration test validation  

---

## System Architecture Principles

### 1. Microservices Design
- **Single Responsibility:** Each service has a focused domain  
- **Independent Deployment:** Services can be deployed separately  
- **Polyglot Persistence:** Right database for right use case  
- **API Gateway:** Unified entry point with routing and aggregation  

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Loose Coupling:** Services communicate via events, not direct calls  
- **Scalability:** Independent scaling of event producers and consumers  
- **Resilience:** Failure in one service doesn't cascade  
- **Auditability:** Complete event history for debugging  

### 3. Cloud-Native Patterns
- **Containerization:** Docker for consistent environments  
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for automated management  
- **Infrastructure as Code:** ARM templates/Terraform for provisioning  
- **Monitoring:** Application Insights for observability  

### 4. Security & Compliance
- **Healthcare Compliance:** HIPAA-ready architecture  
- **Data Encryption:** Encryption at rest and in transit  
- **Access Control:** RBAC and Azure AD integration  
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive activity tracking
